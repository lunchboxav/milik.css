        <h1>A Welcoming Introduction</h1>
<p>Let me take a time to introduce you to who am I. After all, we will spend a bit more time together, so I don't see any harm in opening myself just a little bit, so you can see where I'm coming from.</p>
<h2>The Formative Years</h2>

<p>Mid '90s was very instrumental in shaping up who I really am. I met many interestting characters just on that ime period alone. From my friendly neighbour, to that annoying senior that came very close to bullying me, had another friend came and stopped him from doing so. But it was during this time that I learned the following vital life lessons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always on the look of your friends</li>
<li>Pay good deed forward</li>
<li>Love your family, unconditionally</li>
<li>Money will come, but it's not the means for happiness</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Professional Days</h2>
<p>Even as I started pretty late (comparatively, to others in the field) as a software developer, I realize that the aforementioned lessons still ring true to these days. Imagine the following scenario:</p>
<ol>
<li>A fellow coworker ask you for help</li>
<li>You decide to help him</li>
<li>That person is now empowered to help others, because he sees value in kindness</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Just pay it forward, that's how we keep this world livable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe we can derive a <code>code</code> snippet for that condition</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">if (receiveKindness) {
    payItForward();
} else {
    doGood();
}
</code></pre>
