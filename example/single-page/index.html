          Fighting games have been a significant part of my life ever since I
          was a kid. From Street Fighter II when I was just a kid, all the way
          to it's fifth entry in the series, now that I'm a dad.

          I'm not going to argue, Metallica's ...And Justice for All is their
          favourite album. It hits the perfect balance between technical and
          simplistic, yet manages to constantly pack punches.
